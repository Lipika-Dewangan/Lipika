            These were a gift for my mom for Christmas. She loved them! They were beautiful and of great quality! I like that the back earring is a separate piece from the front earring. It has different holes so you can adjust depending on your lobe size. You just have to be careful when taking them off, because you have three separate pieces to keep track of (the front earring, the hanging earring, and the backing)!

            I LOVE this ear cuff. ??ç It is absolutely stunning and easily the most beautiful piece of jewelry I own. Plus, the sizing and dimensions were just right for my ear. There‚??s a post for pierced ears on the bottom and a wrap around clamp for the cartilage on top. I wore this as a part of a ‚??queen‚?ù costume at an event where I was dancing all night and the cuff stayed on really well... which is saying a lot cause I really move my head around when I dance. It did get a bit painful on the top, especially when it got brushed while hugging people, but the clamp is adjustable, so loosening it did help a bit. It‚??s so beautiful, though, that it was worth any discomfort. Also, I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it did take a week to come to the States, so just be sure to plan accordingly. It‚??s worth the wait!

            The earnings are super cute but they don‚??t come with backs and they start to come out of my ear. My first day wearing them I lost one. So sad that I spent so much money on something I only got to wear once.
        "
"
            I reached out to the buyer to offer my sympathy and a replacement earring but never heard back from her. Indeed, these earrings do not have backings because in terms of design I considered that they are not necessary as long as they ""sit"" on the ear. Generally because I have sold several hundred of these earrings the need for a backing has not been mentioned by a buyer before. However, because I understand that the loss of her earring is something that upset her, I was happy to send her a new replacement earring (with a pair of small silicon backings) if she contacted me back to arrange it.

            I LOVE this ring. It‚??s so beautiful! It has a nice shimmer indoors, but under the lights and sun it sparkles ‚?® it took 3 months to get here because of covid and the fact that for me it was international shipping. After not having it weeks after the supposed arrival date I emailed them to see if they had any info on their side. They contacted the post office and responded to me very quickly about what was going on. (The item was already in my country just not scanned in yet). I was sad, but the wait was worth it for me. I love it so much. THANK YOU!!!
It also came BEAUTIFULLY packaged in a cute suede pouch covered in green tissue w/ a painted wood ladybug sticker. Also received a dried flower and sticker logo. Husband & I are big travelers and will probably frame the flower ???

All standard things were excellent: shipping time, packaging, arrived in perfect condition, were exactly as expected and more, if you are looking for tiny hoop huggie-type earrings this is the place. The idea of wearing  olive branch earrings with everything going on in the US reminds me that peace is possible. If we all start extending an olive branch to one another we can make a change. 
Closure for these is solid and they stay closed despite 3 dogs jumping around my head, showering, running, taking clothing off and on over my head. I wanted hoops that I could put in and leave in. That was my plan until I saw the barb wire and chain link huggies in the same style. I think I'll be back sooner than I planned for some more gorgeous, quality, unique earrings. Pic does not do justice to product.
